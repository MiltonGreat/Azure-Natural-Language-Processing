# Azure-Natural-Language-Processing

This project focused on using Microsoft Azure’s Natural Language Processing (NLP) services to build applications capable of understanding and processing text data. I used Azure’s Text Analytics, Language Understanding (LUIS), and Translator services to detect sentiment, translate text, and build language understanding systems. This project is crucial for developing systems that need to understand and interpret user input in human language, from chatbots to customer support applications.

What I Learned: I learned how to leverage Azure’s NLP tools to transform raw text data into actionable insights. These tools are powerful for automating customer support, improving user experience, and analyzing large volumes of text-based data such as social media posts, reviews, and customer feedback.

Businesses can use Azure NLP services to enhance customer interaction with chatbots, automatically translate content for global audiences, and analyze customer sentiment in real-time. These capabilities lead to better customer service, more personalized experiences, and deeper insights into customer behavior.
